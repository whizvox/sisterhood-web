    </p>
    <h3 class="underline mt-4">Why is this a mod for Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They contacted me first</li>
        <li>KS:RE has built-in modding support, unlike Katawa Shoujo</li>
        <li>KS:RE has 16:9 HD textures, unlike Katawa Shoujo's 4:3 800x600px textures</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="underline mt-4">Why are these acts taking so long to come out?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I have a busy life outside of working on Sisterhoodâ€”mainly work and being a guitarist in a band. I'm
            technically working on this project in my free time, as are a lot of the other people involved.
        </li>
        <li>
            In recent years, I've developed tendinitis in my left hand, which makes it so I have to take frequent breaks
            from typing. Coupled with being a guitarist, I have to balance which days I spend playing guitar and which
            I spend working on Sisterhood.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="underline mt-4">When is Act 2 coming out?</h3>
    <p>
        Act 2 is still in very early stages of development, so it is difficult to narrow down any sort of release date
        as of yet. So the answer is: I have no idea. For perspective, Act 1 took about 8 months to finish development,
        including 1 month of beta testing. Act 2 is much larger in scale, and will require more original backgrounds
        and artwork.

    <h3 class="underline mt-4">How can I help?</h3>

        For the most part, it's already been decided on who's going to work on what. However, for anyone that has
        experience with one of the following, please join <a href="https://discord.gg/GZFSPDNcRE">the Discord</a> and
        contact @whizvox, the project lead.

    <ul>

    <p>
        Alternatively, you can donate to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/M4M512AHJB">Ko-fi page</a>, since I will need to
        commission a large portion of the required assets.
